            <p> With regard to the case of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1869"
                  >Mark</persName> the devout monk and presbyter you have written throughout wisely
               and with the religious feeling and the intelligence that belongs to you. Know however
               that, even if we had not the instance of the saintly bishop <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2567">Eleusinius</persName>, we have many other
               examples provided by the holy fathers in the times of the Arians, which charge us not
               to repel those who have been often perverted, and recurred to the evil thing as
               before, but, as far as is possible, to allow them the last repentance. It is related
               in church histories that <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2611"
                  >Asterius</persName>, who was a sophist and author among the
                  <persName>Arians</persName>," was often received and often returned to his vomit,
               insomuch that this expression of his is cited in histories. He cried out lying on his
               face before everyone and saying, "Trample upon me, the salt which has lost its
               savour." <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2493">Hosius</persName> also, the
               bishop of <pb n="287"/> Corduba, the old man, whom <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/354">Athanasius</persName> who is among the saints
               often called "a man of goodly old age," was often perverted and overcome by the times
               and again received, and many others. Therefore with <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1869">Mark</persName> also this same principle
               should hold good, and he should be received on the basis of a written document, upon
               his anathematizing the heresies of the <persName>Diphysites</persName> and of the
                  <persName>Massalians</persName>, together with the impious men themselves and
               their impiety. For indeed "both the impious man and his impiety are equally hated
               before God," as a wise man said; although the fathers as pilots from motives of
               policy received some men upon the impiety alone being anathematized (I refer to the
                  <foreign>pepragmena</foreign> or things done at Chalcedon), thinking that those
               who did them were also anathematized at the same time in silence, When this is done
               it is absolutely necessary that the office of superintendent should also be entrusted
               to <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1869">Mark</persName>, seeing that the
               majority of the brethren and, if one may so say, all are asking for him as you write.
               Indeed after considering the matter from many points of view I have come to this
               conclusion, that it is better that he should be canonically received now while he is
               humbled, than that, desired as he is by many persons, he should betake himself
               perhaps to the royal among cities, and do things that many are wont to do, and with
               money buy independence, and get the monastery <pb n="288"/> under his control with
               liberty to follow the impiety with head bare and unashamed. I have also received the
               letter that you wrote about the hateful opinions of <persName>Romanus</persName>, in
               which you state that you have read the tome written by me cursorily. But I wish you
               to read it yet again and pay attention to the contents, and to condemn more strongly
               the impious man, and induce the saintly bishops also to do the same, and repudiate
               that wicked man by a common synodical letter addressed by them to my meanness. There
               is yet another thing that I had almost forgotten to make known to your religiousness,
               viz., that the devout <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1869">Mark</persName>
               in what he said displayed an appearance of shrinking from the superintendence of the
               monastery, and seeking only to live at peace, and besides this asserted further that
               a royal letter had assigned the monastery to the apostolic see of the city of the
                  <persName>Antiochenes</persName>, and that the clergymen in <placeName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2386">Tarsus</placeName> had a spite against them,
               and prevented them from lesson-reading and the offering of oblations if they were in
               need, the holy remnants of the bloodless sacrifice being often lacking to them. And I
               said to him and to the man who was with him, "You cannot raise these matters now: but
               for the present you <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1869">Mark</persName>
               must certainly show true repentance by a form of satisfaction and by a change in your
               deeds, and then, if you have the witness of time to the blamelessness of your future
               conduct, we will also go on to settle the said points, if <pb n="289"/> anyone try to
               act perversely towards you, and to do any spiteful and injurious action to your holy
               monastery." Therefore, in order that the questions raised upon these subjects too may
               not be unknown to you, I have added these few words in the letter. Moreover on second
               thoughts I have determined to warn your religiousness of this further point also:
               that, when I was composing the letter to the metropolitan, and I thought that the
               number of brethren living in the monastery was large, I came to the following
               decision: that is that the entrusting of the superintendence to the devout <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1869">Mark</persName> should depend on the opinion
               of the majority. But I learn that there are not more than fifteen: and distinct
               information has been sent me that one or two only are thought to be opposed to him,
               and that it is certainly he who ought to receive the post of superintendent, upon
               giving complete satisfaction with sincerity and with his whole heart, so far as men
               can see. We have also sent an <foreign>ison</foreign> or copy of the form of
               satisfaction which our notaries have drawn up, having compiled it from other forms
               that were previously composed by me in the cases of various persons. The God-loving
                  <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2617">Basil</persName> bishop of
                  <placeName>Pompeiupolis</placeName> has informed us that he has been compelled by
               the God-loving <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2635">Dionysius</persName>
               bishop of the metropolis to undertake an unlawful laying on of hands or ordination.
               If this is really so, it is also proper that your love of <pb n="290"/> God and the
               religious presbyter and logothete <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2678"
                  >John</persName> should take care that it too receive correction. </p>
