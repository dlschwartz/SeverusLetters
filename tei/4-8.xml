               in <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/10">Antioch</placeName>, the devout
               clergymen and those that are among the people, <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/51">Severus</persName> greeting in the <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">Lord</persName>. Neither at an earlier time
               when I left your <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245"
               >Christ</persName>-loving city did you omit——. <add><emph>And after other
                     things.</emph></add> And to others again, showing how great are the benefits of
               sufferings for <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">Christ's</persName>
               sake, he wrote in an epistle, "Unto you it was given not only to believe on <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">Christ</persName>, but also to suffer for His
               sake," calling it a gift given by <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245"
                  >God</persName> that they should suffer in the cause of piety. Fitly therefore and
               as beseems your intelligence and the earnestness of your character you are searching
               and inquiring both as to the exact nature of the right faith, and as to the way to
               observe this with carefulness. For a man to be polluted by the communion of heretics
               ruins all the labours and <pb n="269"/> toils even of the solitary life, and leads to
               hell and final destruction: from which the divine <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1826">John the Evangelist</persName> also tried to
               hinder men, writing thus: [Here follows the citation given on p. 263] The God-clad
                  <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/376">Basil</persName> too, the great
               doctor of the church, wrote in an epistle to a certain monk named <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2778">Urbicius</persName>, saying: [Here follows
               the citation given on p. 259] In the letter to <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2711">count Terence</persName> also he speaks thus:
               "But, even if a man come from heaven itself, but is not in accord with the sound word
               of faith, I cannot reckon him a communicator in the sacraments." And in writing to
               the same <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2711">Terence's</persName>
               daughters who were deaconesses he repeats the same things in a terrifying form,
               because the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2486">Arians</placeName> and
               Fighters against the Spirit were disturbing the churches of <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">God</persName> and were surging against them
               tyrannically: "But they who speak of either the <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">Son</persName> or the Spirit as a creature,
               or reduce Him in any way to a subsidiary and servile office, are far from the truth:
               whose communion one should shun and from whose words one should turn away as being
               destructive of souls." And to <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2781"
                  >Patrophilus the bishop</persName> he wrote thus: "If these things seem to you a
               fit subject for grief, impute the separation to those who were the cause. But, if you
               judge them indifferent, pardon us when we do not consent to be of the leaven of those
               who teach other things." <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/511"
                  >Gregory</persName> also the Theologian wrote thus about the <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2486">Arians</persName> who were in power at that
               time, as <pb n="270"/> I said, and compelled the orthodox to communicate with them
               against their will: "Having made this one charge only, that they did not assent to
               the impiety and were not polluted by the communion; which we shun as serpent's
               poison, that does not hurt the body but blackens the depths of the soul." Let no one
               therefore cause you to depart from that which is right. For "in a very little while
               He that cometh will come and will not tarry": and "He will render to every man
               according to his deeds." For it is in very truth "a fearful thing to fall into the
               hands of the living <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">God</persName>." </p>
