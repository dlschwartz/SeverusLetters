               105th, 106th letter.</head>
            <p> If anyone who knows how to discern spiritually the dispensations of the
                  <persName>Lord</persName>, who does all things with wisdom, will recall to mind
               your struggles on behalf of the orthodox faith— <add><emph>And after other
                     things.</emph></add> Henceforth clothe yourself in the immaterial dress of the
               priesthood, and stand firm. Instead of the ephod take upon your shoulders the
                  <persName>Lord</persName>'s cross; and instead of the tunic woven of fine linen
               and blue stuff put on the many-coloured tunic of virtues; and strengthen yourself by
               the struggles of the martyrs which extended to blood. But assuredly the honourable in
               virginity and first of female martyrs, and skilled maker of these things, I mean the
               holy <persName>Thecla</persName>, will clothe you in such raiment to do honour to her
               vote concerning you. But the crown of the orthodox faith, and purity and good
               character, and sincerity and vehemence of preaching, by which others also will be
               stirred up to the same zeal, will be to you the mitre and the crown of gold and the
               fair-sounding bells. And you are girt with a girdle and a breastpiece, a solitary and
               unwedded walk in life. Wherefore also <persName
                  resp="https://syriaca.org/person/2245">Christ</persName> shall lie upon your
               breast, the Word of <persName>God</persName>, who took flesh for us, who was typified
               beforehand by the robe and knowledge and truth.<note

               dare to find fault with the innovation in the matter of your institution, when so
               many bishops with one accord canonically performed the ordination? That a patriarch
               or a metropolitan or the synod of the province<note

                     ><foreign>έπαρχία.</foreign></note> should according to custom ordain such and
               such a man is not a matter of the strictness of the canons, but rather of church
               discipline. But this discipline we see to have been often neglected in times of
               persecution. Take the holy <persName resp="https://syriaca.org/person/2617"
                  >Basil</persName>. Because the bishops of the province<note
                  resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks" rend="footer"
                     ><foreign>έπαρχία.</foreign></note> were adversely disposed towards him, partly
               from envy, partly because they were attached to the madness of
                  <persName>Arius</persName>, <persName resp="https://syriaca.org/person/511"
                  >Gregory</persName> the Theologian says that he was ordained by bishops outside
               the boundaries, writing thus in the funeral discourse on him: [Here follows the
               citation given above, p. 9]. However, <persName
                  resp="https://syriaca.org/person/2530">Flavian</persName> may be caught by his own
               wings. If he himself, and that when accused of heresy, formerly ordained <persName
                  resp="https://syriaca.org/person/3032">someone</persName> in
                  <placeName>Germanicupolis<!--somehow you can find this specific person, yet not the place? so this city is not on the Syriaca website-->
               </placeName>, and snatched away an ordination that belonged to the metropolitan, let
               him not be annoyed when he has been treated in the same way, when on our side we have
               an advocate in defence of a similar act in the orthodox faith; and what can a man
               think could be a better advocate than this? This has the approval of the holy
                  <persName resp="https://syriaca.org/person/511">Gregory</persName> the Theologian
               also when he writes in this manner in the first of the conciliatory discourses, I
               mean that on the union of the monks, when certain men, perhaps like these, were
               thought to have intro<pb n="14"/>duced an innovation contrary to the law of the
               Church: "For for our part we received the heads also who were given to the severed
               part with joy, inasmuch as they introduced an innovation on behalf of piety and to
               help the right teaching which was in distress, and we did not turn away our faces as
               from enemies, but welcomed them as our brothers, who for a short time were at discord
               respecting the paternal inheritance, in a brotherly but not a wicked manner. And we
               did not praise them on account of the enmity: but we received them on account of the
               zeal. For separation for piety's sake is better than vicious concord. And for this
               reason we made the loss our gain, silently removing by love the supposition that
               there was against us: and to this extent we changed the order of things, that the
               gift should not follow the election, but the election the gift; and we made use of
               other men's hands in this matter, having been a little anticipated by the
                  <persName>Spirit</persName>."<note resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks"
                  rend="footer">Or. vi. II.</note> From the citation it is possible to discern
               clearly that the innovation which was thought to have been introduced at that time
               was one similar to the present position, and that, while the election and the right
               of ordaining belonged to one set of men, others ordained, especially from his
               expression, "and we made use of other men's hands in this matter"; and above again,
               "who for a short time were at discord respecting the paternal inheritance." But he
               shows that those who had the right to elect and ordain, one among whom in <pb n="15"
               /> particular was the holy <persName resp="https://syriaca.org/person/511"
                  >Gregory</persName> himself, concurred in the election with those who on account
               of zeal for the orthodox faith had once made an innovation, by uniting with those who
               separated and made the innovation, and accepting what had been done by them, in that
               they said, "and for this reason we made the loss our gain, silently removing by love
               the supposition that: there was against us; and to this extent we changed the order
               of things, that. the gift should not follow the election, but the election the gift." </p>
            <p> If <persName resp="https://syriaca.org/person/511">Gregory</persName> the
               Theologian, and that being orthodox, or rather a guide and teacher of orthodoxy, bore
               with and endured those who seceded from him out of superfluous zeal, and accepted the
               things done by them by way of innovation, let <persName
                  resp="https://syriaca.org/person/2530">Flavian</persName>, who is infected with
               heresy, either change his evil belief under teaching, and rejoice with us in the
               things done by us; or if he remains such as he is let him justly suffer annoyance,
               and put up with it, enwrapped as he is in the bonds of impiety. But, since there was
               also contained in your letter the question on what conditions it is right to adopt a
               union with those of the same opinions, it is necessary to say this much. It is right
               to unite with those of the same opinions, when they are of the same opinions in
               everything. Putting aside the complete union of the holy churches, since that needs a
               lawful concession on certain points, the man who privately wishes to be united with
               you must in everything seek the same ends; as <persName
                  resp="https://syriaca.org/person/1839">Constantine</persName> also of God-loving
               memory proclaimed to the people before the church; <pb n="16"/> the mention of the
                  <persName>Henotikon</persName> only being passed over as superfluous: for, if it
               does not touch the stumbling-blocks that sprang up at <placeName
                  resp="https://syriaca.org/place/622">Chalcedon</placeName> and separated the
               churches, what is the use of mentioning it? To the pious king this was necessary for
               the general union of the churches, since he was desirous of showing that the king who
               preceded him also had before him the object of bringing into union those who
               separated on account of the synod at <placeName resp="https://syriaca.org/place/622"
                  >Chalcedon</placeName>, and that he is not now the first to introduce this
               question into the churches, as if making an innovation. We for our part therefore
               have written these things out of our poverty, because you bade us do this also,
               giving us an example of a modest or humble disposition. But you will of yourself add
               things greater and better than these, inasmuch as you have already received from the
                  <persName>Spirit</persName> together with the pastorate ability also to feed the
               flock with understanding. </p>
